          RNisarg Foundation, a sustainability-focused NGO, leads Project Sakhi,
          a flagship program dedicated to promoting menstrual health and hygiene
          among Adivasi women residing in remote villages and tribal
          settlements. One of SHFLâ€™s many CSR initiatives is in support of this
          project, that identifies the need for education and access to
          sustainable menstrual products, specifically focusing on the menstrual
          cup (made from medical-grade silicone) as a viable option.
