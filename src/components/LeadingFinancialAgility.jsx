          Our sound financial future is secured through an effective liability
          franchise, supported by our strong credit scores. By consistently
          adding lenders to our portfolio and maintaining a conservative and
          diversified approach to borrowing, we ensure a well-balanced
          asset-liability profile across various maturity periods. This approach
          has led to a record-breaking surge in our Assets Under Management
          (AUM) this year, demonstrating the accomplishment of our strategic
          goals.

          Sustaining financial strength and enriching our portfolio
        </h2>
        <p className=" paragraph text-[#575756]">
          Our financial performance continues to remain strong, with steady
          profit growth that is a result of sound company procedures and
          judicious capital utilisation. The average ticket size of our retail
          portfolio has been consistent, which highlights the steady spending
          habits of our customers. Our effective credit risk management is also
          demonstrated by our improved collection efficiency, even in the face
          of macroeconomic uncertainty.

        <p className=" paragraph text-[#575756]">
          With a prudent investment approach, we have been able to build a
          well-balanced portfolio with consistent quality improvement. Stable
          Gross and Net stage 3 assets and the creation of a better book at a
          stable.annual incremental cost are part of this approach. The
          consistency in delinquency rates further underscores our capability to
          successfully underwrite a wide spectrum of clients.
