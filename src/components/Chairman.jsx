      <p className="text-[#575756]">
        Looking back at the year with contentment, I am honoured to present to
        you the Annual Report, which showcases the robust growth we have
        achieved, demonstrating the strength of our business model. We achieved
        a momentous milestone by surpassing ₹ 13700 crore assets under
        management, being the third affordable housing finance company to do so.

        <p className="text-[#575756]">
          Despite elevated interest rate and global economic headwinds, the
          affordable housing finance market has maintained healthy portfolio
          quality, revenue, and profitability. While we may witness continuation
          in the elevated interest rates regime in the near term, the eventual
          reversal in the interest rate cycle will benefit our business. The
          Indian economy’s resilience in the face of global challenges instils
          optimism fuelled by rapid urbanisation, rising per capita GDP, and an
          expanding middle class. At Shriram Housing Finance Limited (SHFL), we
          have navigated through the challenges posed by global economic
          slowdown and transient geopolitical tensions, emerging as a resilient
          force in the affordable housing finance sector.

          The government’s focus on financial inclusion, increasing financial

          financial products, particularly in non-metropolitan areas. We are
          well-positioned to capitalise on these growth opportunities and
          deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. We serve a niche market
          segment, catering to non-metro markets and targeting self-employed
          customers, addressing the credit gap this segment faces. Our
          specialised understanding of underwriting self-employed individuals
          enables us to devise effective strategies for customer satisfaction.
          With a strong focus on unbanked and underbanked sectors, over 74% of
          our customers belong to the low and middle-income categories, and
          almost 78% are self-employed, promoting entrepreneurship and
          transforming lives in rural and semi-urban India.
