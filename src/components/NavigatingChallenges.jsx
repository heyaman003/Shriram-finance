          Our Risk Management Policy serves as the cornerstone of our operation,
          enabling us to identify and manage risks to our business. Given that
          lending is our core business, we are constantly exposed to a plethora
          of risks, such as those related to credit, liquidity, interest rates
          and operations.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph text-[#575756]  text-xl">
          We have developed custom analytical models, such as Scorecards, the
          Bounce Estimator Tool and the Loss Forecasting Model, to address these
          challenges and facilitate comprehensive risk monitoring and
          assessment. Our Scoring Models are further strengthened by a unique
          Risk Calculation Matrix to assess several objective metrics, such as
          the Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR) and the Loan-to-Value
          ratio (LTV).

          Early Identification of Delinquencies

        <p className="paragraph  text-[#575756]  text-xl">
          Early identification of delinquencies involves promptly recognizing
          potential payment challenges among borrowers. This entails detecting
          warning signs and implementing proactive measures, such as sending
          regular reminders and conducting follow-ups via tele-calling, IVR,
          SMS, and interactive voice bots before due dates. Furthermore,
          offering assistance to address borrower queries helps minimize the
          risk of defaults.
